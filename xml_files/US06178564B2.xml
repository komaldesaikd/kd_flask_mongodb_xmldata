    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to liquid dispensers and in particular to devices for dispensing quantities of liquids, such as cleaning and/or freshening liquids, from under the rim of a toilet bowl.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Toilet bowls require care to prevent the buildup of unsightly deposits, to reduce odors and to prevent bacteria growth.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, toilet bowls have been cleaned, deodorized and disinfected by manual scrubbing with a liquid or powdered cleaning and sanitizing agent.
      <br/>
      This task has required manual labor to keep the toilet bowl clean.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to eliminate the manual scrubbing, various automatic continuous cleaning toilet bowl cleaning products have been proposed.
      <br/>
      One type of product comprises a solid block or solid particles of a cleansing and freshening substance that is suspended from the rim of a toilet bowl in a container that is placed in the path of the flushing water. U.S. Pat. No. 3,529,309 shows an example of this type of toilet bowl cleaning system.
      <br/>
      The solid cleaning blocks have a short lifetime and the release of cleaning and deodorizing agents drops off as the solid block deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Toilet cleaning systems that use a liquid cleaning agent have also been developed.
      <br/>
      For example, European Patent Application EP-0538957 discloses a cleansing and/or freshening unit capable of being suspended from the rim of a toilet bowl for the purpose of introducing liquid active substances from a bottle into the flushing water with each flush.
      <br/>
      Another similar liquid dispensing toilet bowl cleaning system is described in European Patent Application EP-0785315.
      <br/>
      This application acknowledges that one problem with the device disclosed in EP-0538957 is that as the liquid level in the dispensing bottle falls, the rate at which liquid is dispensed falls with time.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The dispensing device described in EP-0785315 was developed as a proposed solution to this problem, and includes a dispensing bottle with a structure that permits both the flow of liquid from the bottle and a return flow of air from outside the bottle to inside the bottle.</p>
    <p num="8">
      While the dispensing device disclosed in EP-0785315 provides an alternative to the solid block toilet cleaning systems described above and to the liquid dispensing device disclosed in EP-0538957, it also has disadvantages.
      <br/>
      For instance, the device described in EP-0785315 requires the use of a porous, liquid-absorbing mass (i.e., a sponge) which always communicates with the cleaning liquid contained in the dispensing bottle and is located in the path of the flushing water of the toilet.
      <br/>
      This system is unduly expensive to manufacture and cannot provide precise control over the volume of liquids dispensed in the flushing water.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Therefore, there is a need for an improved device that can dispense a liquid cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing substance into a toilet.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention provides a liquid dispensing device for suspension from a structure.
      <br/>
      The liquid dispensing device includes a bottle for holding a liquid, a base for holding the bottle, a dispensing plate integral with or attached to the base, and a suspension means for suspending the base from the structure.
      <br/>
      The bottle has a mouth and a closure for covering the mouth, and the base has a piercing post defining a feed conduit and means for opening the closure of the bottle and for placing the feed conduit in fluid communication with the mouth of the bottle.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate of the base has an upper surface including a plurality of feed channels in fluid communication with the feed conduit of the base.
      <br/>
      The feed channels are suitable to convey the liquid from the feed conduit to a dispensing position on the upper surface of the dispensing plate.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In a preferred form, the liquid dispenser is suitable for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      In this form, the suspension means comprise a suspension hook and a guide channel integral with the base.
      <br/>
      The suspension hook has an upper end hook portion that is placed over the toilet rim and a lower end that is slidably inserted in the guide channel such that the lower end of the suspension hook engages an inner surface of the guide channel thereby suspending the base and the bottle under or adjacent the toilet rim.
      <br/>
      In this preferred form, the upper surface of the dispensing plate has a collecting cavity in fluid communication with the feed conduit of the base and in fluid communication with the plurality of feed channels, and the upper surface of the dispensing plate also has a venting slot in fluid communication with the collecting cavity and an edge of the base.
      <br/>
      The venting slot permits ambient air to enter the bottle to displace the liquid dispensed from the bottle.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate in this preferred form may also include a deflector secured to an edge of the dispensing plate.
      <br/>
      The deflector is dimensioned so as to be suitable to contact an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      When the toilet is flushed, a portion of the flushing water contacts a dispensing position on the upper surface of the dispensing plate thereby washing the liquid into the flush water.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In a second version of the invention, there is provided another liquid dispensing device for suspension from a structure.
      <br/>
      The liquid dispensing device includes a bottle for holding a liquid, a base for holding the bottle, a dispensing plate integral with or attached to the base, and a suspension means for suspending the base from the structure.
      <br/>
      The bottle has a mouth and a closure for covering the mouth, and the base has a piercing post defining a feed conduit and means for opening the closure of the bottle and for placing the feed conduit in fluid communication with the mouth of the bottle.
      <br/>
      The base also includes a lower plate which extends outwardly from a wall of the piercing post.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate is integral with or attached to the base in spaced apart relationship with the lower plate of the base, and an upper surface of the dispensing plate receives liquid from the feed conduit.
      <br/>
      The lower plate and the dispensing plate are suitable to convey the liquid from the feed conduit to a dispensing position on the upper surface of the dispensing plate.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In a preferred form of the second version of the invention, the liquid dispenser is suitable for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      In this form, the suspension means comprise a suspension hook and a guide channel integral with the base.
      <br/>
      The suspension hook has an upper end hook portion that is placed over the toilet rim and a lower end that is slidably inserted in the guide channel such that the lower end of the suspension hook engages an inner surface of the guide channel thereby suspending the base and the bottle under or adjacent the toilet rim.
      <br/>
      In this preferred form, the dispensing plate is suitable to be upwardly inclined with respect to an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl, and the lower plate is also suitable to be upwardly inclined with respect to an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the upper surface of the dispensing plate and the lower plate of the base varies along the length of the dispensing plate such that a first spacing between the edge of the lower plate nearest the inner surface of the toilet bowl and the edge of the dispensing plate nearest the inner surface of the toilet bowl is less than a second spacing between the edge of the lower plate furthest from the inner surface of the toilet bowl and the edge of the dispensing plate furthest from the inner surface of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate may also include a deflector secured to an edge of the dispensing plate.
      <br/>
      The deflector is dimensioned so as to be suitable to contact an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      When the toilet is flushed, a portion of the flushing water contacts a dispensing position on the upper surface of the dispensing plate thereby washing the liquid into the flush water.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In both versions of the invention, the base holds the bottle such that the bottle is supported in an inverted position with the mouth of the bottle projecting downwardly such that the liquid can be dispensed from the bottle by gravity.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bottle is shallow and compact to minimize the head space in the bottle.
      <br/>
      When the bottle is filled with liquid, negative pressure or a vacuum (i.e., an equilibrium pressure) exists in the head space in the bottle.
      <br/>
      After installation of the bottle on the base, a portion of the liquid from the bottle flows onto a dispensing position on the dispensing plate.
      <br/>
      When flush water washes the liquid from the dispensing position on the dispensing plate, further liquid is dispensed from the bottle and ambient air passes into the bottle to displace the liquid dispensed from the bottle.
      <br/>
      The volume of ambient air passing into the bottle may be controlled by venting slots or conduits on or adjacent the dispensing plate.
      <br/>
      In this manner, ambient air can act as a meter that allows for a linear and consistent release of liquid formula by assuring that the pressure in the bottle returns to equilibrium pressure after each flush.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention provides a significant improvement over prior liquid dispensing devices, such as those disclosed in EP-0538957 and EP-0785315, wherein a sponge or similar porous absorbent material was placed in the fluid path of the liquid to prevent the liquid from quickly flowing out of an inverted bottle.
      <br/>
      As detailed above, the use of a porous mass in these prior liquid dispensing devices did not allow for precise control over the volume of liquids dispensed in the flushing water due to the variability in the manufacturing of the porous medium.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a liquid dispensing device that can convey liquid from a liquid reservoir to a dispensing position on a dispensing plate in a controlled consistent manner.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it is an advantage of the invention to provide a liquid dispenser for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a toilet bowl such that a controlled, consistent amount of liquid is dispensed into each flush.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      Referring first to FIGS. 1-9, there is shown a liquid dispenser 10 for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      The liquid dispenser 10 includes a bottle 18 for holding a liquid, a base 24 for holding the bottle 18, and a suspension hook 12 for suspending the base 24 and the bottle 18 from the rim of a toilet.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      For ease of manufacture, the suspension hook 12, the bottle 18 and the base 24 are formed as separate components as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      While a variety of materials may be used to form the suspension hook 12, the bottle 18 and the base 24, it is preferable to manufacture these components from an opaque thermoplastic material such as pigmented polyethylene or polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The liquid used in the dispenser may be any liquid formula having the cleaning, foaming, disinfecting and fragrancing characteristics required for the specific toilet cleaning application.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In a preferred form of the bottle 18 shown in FIG. 5, the bottle 18 includes a clear or transparent view stripe 23 that extends vertically on a portion of the otherwise opaque bottle 18.
      <br/>
      The clear view stripe 23 allows the user to see the remaining level of liquid in the bottle 18.
      <br/>
      In one preferred form, the bottle 18 is loaded with approximately 45 milliliters of liquid formula before the device is hooked on the rim.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The base 24 includes an integral elongated upright member 26 that has a guide channel 25 that extends the length of the upright member 26.
      <br/>
      The suspension hook 12 is inserted into the guide channel 25 when the base 24 and bottle 18 are installed on a toilet rim.
      <br/>
      A lower end 13 of the suspension hook 12 includes a tab portion 14 that engages the inner surface of the guide channel 25 in a press fit arrangement upon insertion of the suspension hook 12 into the guide channel 25 such that the suspension hook 12 remains attached to the base 24.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that the telescoping arrangement of the guide channel 25 and the suspension hook 12 allows the liquid dispenser 10 to fit the wide variety of toilet rim configurations.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The base 24 also includes a rear wall 36 that terminates at an upper edge 32.
      <br/>
      The rear wall 36 and the upper edge 32 create a mounting structure 60 that supports the bottle 18 when the bottle 18 is installed on the base 24.
      <br/>
      On a central portion of the mounting structure 60, as seen in FIG. 7, there is provided an annular channel 37 that surrounds a piercing post 27 that is used to carry fluids from the bottle 18 when the liquid dispensing device 10 is installed on a toilet rim.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIG. 9, the installation of the bottle 18 on the base 24 is shown in detail.
      <br/>
      The piercing post 27 of the base 24 comprises a cylindrical tubular section 28 that forms a feed conduit 31.
      <br/>
      An upper end 29 of the tubular section 28 terminates obliquely to form an elliptical mouth.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The bottle 18 includes a circular mouth 19 that is covered by a closure 20 that seals the liquid contents in the bottle 18 for shipment and storage.
      <br/>
      In the version of the bottle shown in the FIG. 9, the closure 20 is a thermoplastic cap with a channel that engages a circular flange at the mouth 19 of the bottle 18.
      <br/>
      Other closures, such as foil or plastic film, would also be suitable for sealing the mouth 19 of the bottle 18.
      <br/>
      The central portion of the closure 20 shown in FIG. 9 has a frangible seal 21 with a circular area 22 of reduced thickness.
      <br/>
      During installation, the bottle 18 is oriented over the piercing post 27 of the base 24 such that the circular inner wall of the closure 20 approximately lines up with the circular outer surface of the piercing post 27, and the bottle is moved in direction A until the upper end 29 of the piercing post 27 causes the circular area 22 of the frangible seal 21 to fracture.
      <br/>
      The feed conduit 31 of the base is then placed in fluid communication with the mouth 19 of the bottle 18 and liquid may flow from the bottle 18 through the feed conduit 31 and out of dispensing hole 38 at the bottom of the piercing post 27 by way of gravity.
      <br/>
      By properly dimensioning the piercing post 27 and the closure 20 and the mouth 19 of the bottle 18, a fluid tight seal is formed when the bottle is installed on the base 24.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      At the bottom of the base 24, there is a liquid dispensing plate 40 that assists in distribution of the liquid formula into the flush water.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate 40 may be a separate component that is attached to the base or may be formed integral with the base 24.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate 40 is preferably formed from a non-porous thermoplastic material such as pigmented polyethylene or polypropylene.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIGS. 8, 10A, 10B, 10C and 11A show the configuration of a first version of the dispensing plate 40 and its positioning on the base 24.
      <br/>
      Referring first to FIG. 11A, it can be seen the dispensing plate 40 has an upper surface 42 with a series of capillary channels 48 that radiate out from a collecting cavity 44 that is formed in the upper surface 42 at a position inwardly spaced from an edge 43 of the base 24.
      <br/>
      The capillary channels 48 may have a variety of transverse cross-sectional shapes, and preferably, the capillary channels 48 have a square, rectangular or triangular transverse cross-sectional shape.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Looking at FIGS. 10A, 10B, 10C, it can be seen that the depth of the capillary channels 48 may also be configured in a variety of fashions.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10A, the lower surface 49 of the capillary channel 48 is coplanar with the lower surface 52 of the collecting cavity 44 from the collecting cavity 44 to an outer end 50 of the capillary channel 48 such that the depth of the capillary channel 48 is substantially equal to the depth of the collecting cavity 44.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10B, the lower surface 49b of the capillary channel 48 descends in a step-wise fashion from the lower surface 52 of the collecting cavity 44 to the outer end 50 of the capillary channel 48.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 10C, the lower surface 49c of the capillary channel 48 is positioned below the lower surface 52 of the collecting cavity 44 from the collecting cavity 44 to the outer end 50 of the capillary channel 48 such that the depth of the capillary channel 48 is greater than the depth of the collecting cavity 44.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Other depth configurations of the capillary channels 48 are also possible.
      <br/>
      For instance, the lower surface 49 of the capillary channel 48 may be inclined downwardly in the direction of the its outer end 50 with respect to the lower surface 52 of the collecting cavity 44.
      <br/>
      Each of these depthwise constructions of the capillary channels can serve to control the distribution of liquid to the toilet as will be herein after described.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Looking at FIGS. 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E, it can be seen that various layouts of the capillary channels 48 and the collecting cavity in the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40 are also possible.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11A, the collecting cavity 44 has an oblong shape that is oriented substantially parallel to the direction of the major axis of the dispensing plate 40 and the capillary channels 48 radiate outward from a side of the oblong collecting cavity 44.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11B, a collecting cavity 44b has a crescent shape having its major axis oriented substantially parallel to the direction of the major axis of a dispensing plate 40b and capillary channels 48b radiate outward from a side of the crescent collecting cavity 44b.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11C, a collecting cavity 44c has an oblong shape having its major axis oriented substantially parallel to the direction of the major axis of a dispensing plate 40c and capillary channels 48c radiate outward from a side of the oblong collecting cavity 44c and increase in width as they move away from the oblong collecting cavity 44c.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In FIG. 11D, a collecting cavity 44d has an oblong shape having its major axis oriented substantially normal to the direction of the major axis of a dispensing plate 40d and capillary channels 48d radiate outward from both sides of the oblong collecting cavity 44d such that a major portion of at least some of the capillary channels 48d is substantially parallel to the direction of the major axis of a dispensing plate 40d.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 11E, a collecting cavity 44e has an oblong shape having its major axis oriented substantially parallel to the direction of the major axis of a dispensing plate 40e and capillary channels 48e radiate outward from a side of the oblong collecting cavity 44e in a random fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Turning now to FIG. 8, the positioning of the dispensing plate 40 with respect to the other structures of the base 24 is best shown.
      <br/>
      The dispensing plate 40 is attached to the base (whether in a separate step or as part of the molding of the base) such that the collecting cavity 44 of the dispensing plate 40 is placed in fluid communication with the feed conduit 31 of the base 24.
      <br/>
      In the version of the invention shown in FIG. 8, the dispensing hole 38 at the bottom of the piercing post 27 is used to provide a fluid path between feed conduit 31 and the collecting cavity 44 of the dispensing plate 40.
      <br/>
      As a result of this configuration, liquid flows out of the bottle 18, into the feed conduit 31 of the base 24, through the dispensing hole 38 and into the collecting cavity 44 of the dispensing plate 40.
      <br/>
      Liquid then flows from the collecting cavity 44 of the dispensing plate 40 into the capillary channels 48 in the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40.
      <br/>
      The liquid then continues to move toward the outer end 50 of the capillary channels 48 where the liquid is dispensed to the toilet as will be hereinafter described.
      <br/>
      Various means can be used to move the liquid from the collecting cavity 44 of the dispensing plate 40 into the capillary channels 48.
      <br/>
      First, the capillary action provided by adherence of the fluid to the sides of the capillary channels 48 serves to move the liquid toward the outer end 50 of the capillary channels 48.
      <br/>
      Second, the capillary channels 48 may have a depth greater than the depth of the collecting cavity 44, such as is shown in FIGS. 10B and 10C and described above, that serves to move the liquid from the collecting cavity 44 and toward the outer end 50 of the capillary channels 48
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Third, the dispensing plate 40 may be inclined downwardly such that the collecting cavity 44 is higher than the capillary channels 48.
      <br/>
      For instance, it can be seen in FIG. 8 that the dispensing plate 40 is angled downward at an angle X with respect to horizontal line H. In this arrangement of the dispensing plate 40, the collecting cavity 44 is higher than the capillary channels 48 and liquid flows downward from the collecting cavity 44 to the capillary channels 48.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that by arranging the dispensing plate 40 and the base 24 such that angle X is between about 5 degrees and about 20 degrees, enhanced liquid flow properties can be attained.
      <br/>
      The downward angle of the dispensing plate 40 also serves to minimize water uptake into the bottle 18 during operation.
      <br/>
      Of course, each of these methods of controlling liquid flow from the collecting cavity 44 into the capillary channels 48 can be used alone or in conjunction with the other available methods.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Having described the means for moving liquid from the bottle 18 to a position on the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40, the use of the liquid dispensing device 10 can be described by reference to FIGS. 12 and 13. FIG. 12 illustrates the configuration of the liquid dispensing device 10 when used with a toilet 16B with an open rim.
      <br/>
      With the liquid dispensing device 10 suspended from the rim of toilet 16B, it can be seen that the stream of flushing water W will contact the dispensing plate 40 with each flush.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 illustrates the configuration of the liquid dispensing device 10 when used with a toilet 16A with a box rim.
      <br/>
      With the liquid dispensing device 10 suspended from the rim of toilet 16A, it can be seen that the stream of flushing water W will also contact the dispensing plate 40 with each flush.
      <br/>
      When the flushing water contacts the dispensing plate 40 in FIGS. 12 and 13, the flush water mixes with the liquid present in the capillary channels 48 on the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40 and then is distributed into the toilet.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      After the flushing water washes liquid from a dispensing portion of the dispensing plate 40 into the toilet water, a fresh supply of liquid is distributed from the bottle 18 to the capillary channels 48 as described above.
      <br/>
      In order to allow air to vent up into the bottle 18 when liquid is dispensed into the flushing water, there is provided a venting slot 46 (shown best in FIGS. 8, 10A and 11A) in the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40.
      <br/>
      The venting slot 46 provides a fluid path between the collecting cavity 44 and the edge 43 of the base 24.
      <br/>
      The fluid path permits ambient air to enter the bottle 18 to displace liquid dispensed therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Looking now at FIG. 14, there is shown an optional feature of the liquid dispenser 10 that serves to control the distribution of the liquid formula into the toilet water.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a deflector 55 is attached to the edge of the dispensing plate 40 to further control the distribution of the liquid formula into the toilet water.
      <br/>
      The deflector 55 allows the liquid dispenser 10 to accommodate the wide variety of toilet bowl contours in the numerous toilets on the market.
      <br/>
      In one version of the deflector 55, the deflector 55 is formed from a flexible material and acts as flexible membrane, conforming to the shape of the inner surface of the toilet bowl allowing toilet flush water from the toilet to be channeled over the dispensing plate 40, further insuring that the liquid formula is washed into the toilet at every flush.
      <br/>
      This version of the deflector 55 may be formed by a multi-injection molding technique wherein two different thermoplastic materials, a soft wiper material for the flexible deflector and a harder material for the dispensing plate are molded together.
      <br/>
      In another version of the deflector, the deflector is hinged to the edge of the dispensing plate so that the deflector can conform to the shape of the inner surface of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      In still another version of the deflector, the deflector and the dispensing plate are configured such that the dispensing plate includes guide slots that engage the deflector and allow the deflector to slide toward and away from the edge of the dispensing plate so that the deflector can conform to the shape of the inner surface of the toilet bowl.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The use of the capillary dispensing method implemented by the liquid dispenser 10 in accordance with the invention provides for delivery of a linear and consistent amount of liquid formula to the flush water.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of the liquid dispenser is designed to last between 300 and 450 flushes, providing consistent foaming, cleaning, disinfecting and fragrancing at each flush, from the first flush to the last flush.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that the use of capillary channels on the dispensing plate is very significant in delivering a steady level of fragrance between flushes as the surface area for the capillary channels insures that adequate fragrance is delivered to the atmosphere after each flush.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      An alternative configuration of the piercing post of the liquid dispenser is shown in FIGS. 15 and 15A.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a piercing post 27a has a central venting conduit 28a and fins 30 that extend outwardly from the central venting conduit 28a.
      <br/>
      The central venting conduit 28a and the fins 30 define feed conduits 31a.
      <br/>
      An upper end 29a of the central venting conduit 28a of the piercing post 27a is used to open the closure 20 of the bottle by causing the circular area 22 of the frangible seal 21 to fracture.
      <br/>
      The feed conduits 31a are then placed in fluid communication with the mouth 19 of the bottle 18 and liquid may flow from the bottle 18 through the feed conduits 31a and onto the upper surface 42 of the dispensing plate 40.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the piercing post 27a, air is vented up into the bottle 18 through a hole 35 in the dispensing plate and through the central venting conduit 28a when liquid is dispensed into the flushing water.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Referring to FIG. 16, there is shown another version of a liquid dispenser 10A for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      In this version of the invention, a modified base 24a is used for holding the bottle 18.
      <br/>
      The base 24a has essentially the same features as the base 24 shown in FIGS. 1-9 and described above.
      <br/>
      However, a dispensing hole 38a is provided at a central portion at the bottom of the piercing post 27 of base 24a and the base 24a includes a lower plate 34 that extends outwardly from a wall of the piercing post 27.
      <br/>
      The lower surface of the lower plate 34 also includes a flow groove 39 that serves to channel liquid from the dispensing hole 38a toward the edge of the lower plate 34.
      <br/>
      The liquid dispenser 10A also includes a dispensing plate 40a that is integral with or attached to the base 24a in spaced apart relationship with the lower plate 34 of the base 24a.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, an upper surface 42g of the dispensing plate 40a receives liquid from the feed conduit 31 through the dispensing hole 38a.
      <br/>
      The liquid dispenser 10A is configured such that the spacing between the upper surface 42g of the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 of the base 24a varies along the length of the dispensing plate 40a.
      <br/>
      It can be seen in FIG. 16 that distance D1 is greater than distance D2 between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 of the base 24a.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When the liquid dispenser 10A of FIG. 16 is installed on a toilet rim, the edge of the dispensing plate 40a nearest the inner surface of the toilet bowl and the edge of lower plate 34 nearest the inner surface of the toilet bowl are closest together.
      <br/>
      This is depicted as dimension D3 in FIG. 16. As the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 move away from the inner surface of the toilet bowl, the spacing between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 increases.
      <br/>
      At the edge of the dispensing plate 40a furthest from the inner surface of the toilet bowl and the edge of lower plate 34 furthest from the inner surface of the toilet bowl, a venting space 58 is created between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 to allow air to vent up into the bottle 18 th rough the feed conduit 31 when liquid is dispensed into the flushing water.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      It has been determined that the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 should be tilted downward in order for liquid formula to accumulate on the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 where they are closest together.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the lower plate 34 is upwardly inclined with respect to an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      This is shown in FIG. 16 wherein the lower plate 34 is angled downward at an angle Y with respect to horizontal line H. Also, the dispensing plate 40a is upwardly inclined with respect to an inner surface of the toilet bowl when the liquid dispenser is installed on the rim of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that by arranging the dispensing plate 40a and lower plate 34 such that angle Y is between about 5 degrees and about 15 degrees, enhanced liquid flow properties can be attained.
      <br/>
      In addition, water uptake is minimized with the inclined relationship of the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 and the inner surface of the toilet bowl.
      <br/>
      A flexible deflector 55a may also be attached to the edge of the dispensing plate 40a to further control the distribution of the liquid formula into the toilet water as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The spacing between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 is varied depending on the type of liquid used in the bottle 18.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it has been discovered that the viscosity of the liquid and the surface tension of the liquid are the critical factors in determining the precise spacing desired between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 at various points along the length of the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34.
      <br/>
      By arranging the spacing between the dispensing plate 40a and the lower plate 34 in dependence on the values of the viscosity and the surface tension of the liquid, the flow of liquid to the edge of the dispensing plate 40a can be controlled and therefore, the amount of liquid dispensed in each flush can be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the preferred embodiments, which have been presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation.
      <br/>
      For example, the liquid dispensing device may be used to dispense liquids in locations other than the rim of a toilet bowl (e.g., a bathtub).
