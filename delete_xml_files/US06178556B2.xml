      <br/>
      A body part protector for being custom-fitted to a body part, including at least two protective pad inserts, each of the pad inserts having an initially flexible protective layer formed of a support material impregnated with a moisture-curable resin which hardens upon curing to form a rigid structure which retains a body part-defined shape into which it is molded during curing.
      <br/>
      The protective pad inserts are stored in moisture-proof conditions until use to prevent hardening.
      <br/>
      A pad encloses the at least two protective pad inserts, and is conformable to the molded shape of the pad inserts.
      <br/>
      A hard shell outer protector is adapted for receiving and carrying on an inner, concave surface thereof the pad and the at least two protective pad inserts positioned therein in protective position on the leg between the leg and the outer protector, the outer protector and the pad having complementary fastening elements for releasably securing the pad to the outer protector.
      <br/>
      Fasteners are carried by the hard shell outer protector for securing the molded and assembled body part protector to the body part to be protected.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a custom-fitted athletic body part protector.
      <br/>
      The guard is used for preventing injury to the player and to protect previous injuries while sports competition continues.
      <br/>
      The disclosure of this application relates specifically to a baseball knee, shin and foot protector, commonly referred to as a "shin protector" or "catcher's leg guard," such as used by catchers, although the invention relates to and has application to any body-part protector.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The invention takes advantage of polymer chemistry to permit quick and easy molding of a pad to the body part to be protected.
      <br/>
      Shock attenuation is increased since the custom fit provides spreads contact between the protective pad and the body member over a wider surface area.
      <br/>
      Instead of buying one of a few standard sizes, a protector according to the invention can be molded exactly to the shape of the body part of the user, thus obtaining a more accurate and thus more protective fit.
      <br/>
      The protector may then be held in place by straps or bands.
      <br/>
      The shin protector provides multiple layers of protection, and includes an outer shell which is attached over the custom-molded portion of the protector.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Prior art body protectors include numerous types of guards which are fitted over the body part, such as the shin.
      <br/>
      These pads typically include a soft component to place near the skin and a hard, shell-like outer cover.
      <br/>
      The soft component is intended not only to provide a cushion, but also to accommodate itself to the varying configurations of differing sized and shaped body parts with a cantilever system of protection.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the cushioned part is substantially greater in thickness than required merely to provide the required amount of shock attenuation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Other prior art devices include pads which are constructed of thermosetting materials, which are heated and then formed to the body while heated.
      <br/>
      These products require a source of heat, and are susceptible to either over-or-underheating.
      <br/>
      In addition, body heat itself can soften or at least increase the flexibility of the pad, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of the protection offered by the pad.
      <br/>
      Some prior art pads include air bladders which provide an air cushion against injurious blows.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Other prior art devices have a plurality of connected-together segments which are hinged for limited movement relative to each other, on the theory that such movement permits the pad to more closely conform to the body part.
      <br/>
      All of these prior art devices achieve only an approximation of a truly proper and anatomically correct fit.
      <br/>
      Catcher's leg guards are typically made in a limited number of sizes, and the catcher selects the size which approximates his leg size.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the guards are shared among several players.

    <p num="6">
      The present invention permits quick and easy application of a protective pad to a body part in such a way as to achieve a true custom fit.
      <br/>
      The moisture curable resin system used results in a very rigid pad, which holds the shape of the molded pad to a very high degree.
      <br/>
      No heat is required, and a source of water is the only additional substance necessary to achieve a cure.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Atmospheric moisture alone will cure the pad into its hardened position in a relatively short period of time, but the resin in or on the pad will typically be activated by dipping in water.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE</heading>
    <p num="36">
      Referring now specifically to the drawings, FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a body part protector according to an embodiment of the invention is shown.
      <br/>
      The body part protector as shown in the drawings is a catcher's leg guard 10 particularly intended for use by a baseball or softball catcher.
      <br/>
      As described, below, the catcher's leg guard is assembled from an number of components which collectively provide significant protection to the knee, lower leg and foot of the player, while permitting a high degree of flexibility necessary to the player to manoeuver.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The catcher's leg guard 10 is assembled from outer hard shell components which cover custom-molded and padded components.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the hard shell components include two upper knee protectors 11 and 12, a principal knee protector 13, an elongate shin guard 14, an upper foot protector 15 and a lower foot protector 16.
      <br/>
      These elements are molded of polyethylene or another hard, impact-resistant, light-weight plastic with a padded backing.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The upper knee protector 11 is riveted onto a vinyl-covered pad 19 and is attached to the principal knee protector 13 by a pair of straps 22 (FIG. 4) and rivets (not shown).
      <br/>
      The upper knee protector 12 overlies the junction between the upper knee protector 11 and the principal knee protector 13 and is flexibly-attached to the upper knee protector 11 by a pair of riveted straps 24.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The principal knee protector 13 is riveted onto a vinyl-covered pad 26 which includes a soft padded segment 27 positioned between the principal knee protector 13 and the elongate shin guard 14.
      <br/>
      The pad 26 with the principal knee protector 13 thereon is flexibly-attached to a shin pad 28 which extends from the knee to the ankle.
      <br/>
      Attachment is by a hook-and-loop strap 29 attached to the shin pad 28 and extending through slot 30 in the hard shell shin guard 14 and doubled over itself so that the complementary hooks and loops interlock.
      <br/>
      The hard shell shin guard 14 is attached to the shin pad 28 by hook-and-loop straps 32 attached to the shin pad 28 and extending through slots 33 in the hard shell shin guard 14 and doubled over themselves so that the complementary hooks and loops interlock.
      <br/>
      In addition, the inner side of the hard shell shin guard 14 includes longitudinally-extending strip of hook or loop material 29 which interconnects with a complementary strip of hook or loop material (not shown) on the outer face of the underlying shin pad 28.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The upper and lower foot protectors 15 and 16 are each riveted to a strap 34 which is riveted to the bottom of the shin pad 28 and hard shell shin guard 14.
      <br/>
      Both the upper and lower foot protectors 15 and 16 are padded on the back side with, for example, EVA foam.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As is shown by reference to FIGS. 1-4, the individual elements of catcher's leg guard 10 extend from above the knee to above the toes of the foot, thereby providing comprehensive protection to these areas.
      <br/>
      The catcher's shin guard 10 is held in place on the leg and foot by a series of elastic hook straps 35 which are attached to one side of the catcher's shin guard 10 by rivets and hook into D-rings 36.
      <br/>
      The straps 35 are themselves adjustable in length by adjustment rings 38 (see FIG. 4)) through which the straps are doubled.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The catcher's leg guard 10 is custom-formed to the leg of a particular player by means of three custom-formable protective pad inserts 40, 45 and 50, each of which are constructed identically but differently sized to fit within individual pockets.
      <br/>
      As is best shown in FIG. 4, the back side of the upper knee protector pad 19 includes a fabric pocket 41 for holding the pad insert 40.
      <br/>
      The pocket 41 is releaseably closable by complementary hook-and-loop fastener strips 42, 43.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The principal knee protector pad 26 includes a narrow, laterally-extending fabric pocket 46 for holding pad insert 45.
      <br/>
      The pocket 46 is releaseably closable by a hook-and-loop fastener strip 47 which mates with a complementary strip on the interior of the pocket, not shown.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The shin pad 28 includes a large fabric pocket 51 for holding pad insert 50.
      <br/>
      The pocket 51 is releaseably closable by a hook-and-loop fastener strip 52 which mates with a complementary strip on the interior of the pocket 51, not shown.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Each of the fabric pockets 41, 46 and 51 include additional lightweight foam padding which further protects the leg.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In general, each of the pad inserts 40, 45, 50 includes a support material in the form of a substrate coated or impregnated with a moisture-curable resin which is flexible in the absence of moisture, but which rapidly hardens when exposed to moisture.
      <br/>
      The structure of these pad inserts 40, 45 and 50 is described below with specific reference to pad insert 50.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      As is shown in FIG. 5, the pad insert 50 is initially packaged in an outer moisture-impervious laminated foil pouch 60 in which the pad insert 50 is sealed in the absence of moisture.
      <br/>
      The preferred structure of the outer moisture-impervious pouch 60 includes a 0.5 mil aluminum foil sheet sandwiched between two layers of low density polyethylene film, each layer having a thickness of 2 mils.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the pouch 60 can include an outer layer of laminated 60 gauge bi-axially oriented nylon film.
      <br/>
      This laminate structure, when properly formed into an envelope and sealed, will prevent moisture intrusion indefinitely.
      <br/>
      The pouch 60 is shown with a flexible, resin coated or impregnated pad insert 50 therein.
      <br/>
      Pad inserts 40 and 45 are also packaged in suitably-sized pouches as described above, or may be packaged together with the pad insert 50 in a single pouch for removal and application at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Referring now to FIG. 6, pad insert 50, shown in a molded configuration, comprises an overlying, open knitted fabric 51 such as a product known as Tietex, and a skin-side closed-cell EVA pad 52, which is perforated to permit water to easily reach the substrate during molding and to permit air and moisture flow from the body of the wearer during use.
      <br/>
      A moisture-curable substrate 53 formed of six layers of knitted or woven fiberglass fabric 53A-F impregnated with a moisture-curable resin which hardens upon curing to form a rigid structure which retains shape of the body part onto which it is molded during curing.
      <br/>
      The particular embodiment illustrated in this application contains six layers of fiberglass fabric, but many other variations are equally suitable.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Other fabrics which may be suitable for the substrate 53 include fabrics made of a composition of aluminum oxide, silicone oxide and boron oxide and sold under the trademark Nextel 440 by Thermostatic Industries, Inc.; silica-based fabrics, high modulus fabrics sold under the DuPont trademark "Kevlar."</p>
    <p num="50">
      The particular suitable alternate substrate is a single thickness sheet of random laid non-continuous polyester nonwoven fabric incorporating a styrene-soluble binder filled 60 percent by volume with plastic microspheres.
      <br/>
      The product is sold under the trademark "Firet Coremate XM by Baltek.
      <br/>
      This product is available in 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm thicknesses.
      <br/>
      The 2 mm thickness has been found suitable, and weighs 2.7-3.2 oz/yd2, has a cured specific gravity of 31.0-37.0 lb/ft3, and a resin consumption of 3.1-3.3 oz/ft3. As used in this application, the term "lightweight" and "low density" each refer to a product having values in relation to thickness within the general ranges set out above.
      <br/>
      For example, a guard made in accordance with the principles set out in this application weighs in the range of 50-100 grams.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Other Firet Coremat grades, such as Firet Coremat XX and Firet Coremat XW may also be suitable.
      <br/>
      These grades are filled with plastic microspheres to 50 percent by volume.
      <br/>
      Other products which may be suitable include a low density, nonwoven continuous strand fabric such as BaltekMat T-2000.
      <br/>
      This product has characteristics which are generally similar to Firet Coremat, but is generally unavailable in small quantities.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The fiberglass fabric layers 53A-53F are impregnated or coated with a moisture-curable resin such as polyisocyanate as described, in full U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,299. This reactive system remains stable when maintained in substantially moisture-free conditions, such as in the moisture-impervious pouch but hardens upon exposure to sufficient moisture to form a rigid, self-supporting structure.

    <p num="54">A complete discussion of the parameters of the reactive system, the manner of production and the variables which apply are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,262.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The polyisocyanate resin remains in a viscous, liquid unhardened state so long as the resin is not exposed to moisture.
      <br/>
      This permits the fiberglass substrate 53 and any flexible structure, such as the padding layer 52 to remain flexible and moldable so long as the resin is not exposed to moisture, and for a relatively short period of time after exposure to moisture.
      <br/>
      The curing time can be controlled to some extent by the quantity of water to which the resin is exposed.
      <br/>
      For example, exposure to water by dipping will result in quite rapid curing, while merely allowing the resin to be exposed to air will cause long curing times proportional to the amount of humidity in the air to which it is exposed.
    </p>
    <p num="56">As also shown in FIG. 6, sewing stitches 56, such as overedge seaming stitches, enclose the substrate 53 within the outer fabric layer 51 and the foam layer 52 and form a unitary structure.</p>
    <p num="57">
      The structure of the substrate 53 is more clearly shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      To permit easy conformance of the relatively large pad 50 to the shin, the substrate 53 is formed of individually-shaped segments 54A-E.
      <br/>
      The lines of demarcation which form the boundaries between the separate segments 54A-E act with the fabric layer 51 and foam layer 52 as hinges to permit the pad 50 to be easily formed around the leg when being molded.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      To form the catcher's leg guard 10 to a particular leg, the pad inserts 40, 45 and 50 arc removed from their respective pouches and wetted.
      <br/>
      They are immediately inserted into their respective pockets 41, 46 and 51, and the catcher's leg guard 10 is strapped to the leg.
      <br/>
      An additional wrapping, such as elastic bandage, may also be used to closely conform the catcher's leg guard 10 to the leg during curing.
      <br/>
      Curing generally occurs within about 10 minutes, hardening the pad inserts 40, 45 and 50 into the exact shape assumed when applied to the leg.
      <br/>
      The catcher's leg guard 10 is thus custom-formed to the particular leg and may be used solely by an individual player.
      <br/>
      The shape of the hard shell components and the pad inserts to which they are attached are not permanently changed.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a single catcher's leg guard 10 may be used by two or more players by exchanging pad inserts 40, 45 and 50 molded for one player for pad inserts 40, 45 and 50 molded to fit another player.
      <br/>
      The exchange takes place very quickly and provides an economical way of permitting enhanced safety to each of several catchers.
