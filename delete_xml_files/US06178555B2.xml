    <p num="25">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1 thereof, a new lower leg and foot cover embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.</p>
    <p num="26">
      As best illustrated in FIG. 1, the lower leg and foot cover 10 generally comprises a knee cover which is coupled to an upper end of a flexible lower leg cover.
      <br/>
      A flexible shoe cover is coupled to a lower end of the lower leg cover.
      <br/>
      Flexible straps are provided for securing the knee cover and the lower leg cover to the wearer's leg.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In use, the cover 10 is designed for protecting the front of a wearer's lower leg region and the front of the wearer's shoe from soiling and splatters such as from splashes, precipitation, paint over-spray, and even cement and plaster splatters and spills.
      <br/>
      In closer detail the cover 10 includes a generally oval-shaped knee cover 11 designed for covering a knee region of a wearer.
      <br/>
      The knee cover comprises a rigid material such as a hard plastic material to provide additional protection when the wearer is kneeling.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a generally oval shaped resiliently deformable pad 12 is detachably attached to a back face of the knee cover such that the pad is designed for interposing between the knee cover and the wearer's knee.
      <br/>
      Even more preferably, the pad comprises a resiliently deformable foamed material.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the back face of the knee cover ideally has a pair of opposing rails 13,14 defining a pair of channels between the rails and the back face of the knee cover, the pad is inserted into the channels to detachably attach the pad to the back face of the knee cover.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The cover 10 also includes a flexible lower leg cover 15 designed for covering the front of a shin region of the wearer.
      <br/>
      The lower leg cover has a generally rectangular outer perimeter and upper and lower ends 16,17.
      <br/>
      The upper end of the lower leg cover is coupled to the knee cover.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the upper end of the lower leg cover has a flexible connecting flap 18 coupling the upper end of the lower leg cover to the knee cover.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The cover 10 further includes a flexible shoe cover 19 designed for covering a toe region and front upper region of a shoe of the wearer.
      <br/>
      The shoe cover has an upper portion 20 designed for positioning over the front upper region of the wearer's shoe and a front region 21 designed for positioning in front of the toe region of the wearer's shoe.
      <br/>
      The shoe cover has a back end 22 located adjacent the upper region of the shoe cover.
      <br/>
      The back end of the shoe cover is connected to the lower end of the lower leg cover such that the shoe cover forwardly extends from the lower end of the lower leg cover.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The lower leg cover and the shoe cover each comprises a flexible water repellant material for repelling or resisting the passage of water through the lower leg cover and that also has pores therethrough designed for permitting the passage of air through the lower leg cover.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the lower leg cover comprises a water repellant, breathable laminated fabric 23 such as microporous polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known under the trade-name "GORE-TEX" and which is made by stretching polymer in a controlled was so as to create fine fore which allow diffusion of air and water vapor but prevent liquid water ingress.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A generally right-angled-bent ankle cover 24 is interposed between the lower end of the lower leg cover and the back end of the shoe cover to connect the lower end of the lower leg cover and the back end of the shoe cover.
      <br/>
      The ankle cover is designed for covering the front of the wearer's ankle.
      <br/>
      The ankle cover has upper and lower portions 25,26 generally extending at a right-angle to one another.
      <br/>
      The upper portion of the ankle connector is positioned adjacent the lower end of the lower leg cover and the lower portion of the ankle cover is positioned adjacent the back end of the shoe cover.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The ankle cover comprises a resiliently deflectable material such as a resiliently deflectable plastic material that is also water impermeable to permit passage of water therethrough to permit deflecting of the upper and lower portions of the ankle cover with respect to one another so that the ankle cover does not excessively hinder the wearer's walk.
      <br/>
      The ankle cover also preferably has a plurality of pleats 27 or grooves for aiding deflection of the ankle cover.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The knee cover has a flexible strap 28 designed for wrapping around the back of the wearer's knee to secure the knee cover to the wearer's knee.
      <br/>
      The strap of the knee cover preferably has a break therein and a hook and loop fastener 29 connecting together ends of the strap of the knee cover formed by the break of the strap of the knee cover.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the lower leg cover has a pair of flexible straps 30,31 designed for wrapping around the back of the wearer's lower leg to secure the lower leg cover to the wearer's lower leg.
      <br/>
      A first of the straps 30 of the lower leg cover is positioned adjacent the upper end of the lower leg cover while a second of the straps 31 of the lower leg cover is positioned adjacent the lower end of the lower leg cover.
      <br/>
      Like the strap of the knee cover, the straps of the lower leg cover each preferably have a break therein and a hook and loop fastener connecting together ends of the respective strap formed by the break of the particular strap.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="35">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
